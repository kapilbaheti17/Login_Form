# Login Form
This is the login form performing the basic login and new user sign up operations. 

The Idea of the application is to implement the basic knowledge of JSP and Servlets that we gained in our sessions of the same.

The form for the new user to signup is shown below. 

The User can create the account by entering the details here which will be stored in the table in the database.

![New User Sign UP](/Two.jpg?raw=true "New User Signup Form")

As soon as the user hits the submit button he/she will be redirected to page showing successful message:
![Success](/Five.jpg?raw=true "Success")

The main login form is shown below with cookies mentioned and session tracked user have to enter the details.
![Login Form](/One.jpg?raw=true "Login Form")

If the username and password is valid they will be redirected to the page where it will be displayed that whether the cookies are set or not based on the user selection of remember me.
With Remember Me Selection the page is:
![Cookie Set](/Four.jpg?raw=true "Remember Me")
Without Remeber Me"
![No Cookie Set](/Three.jpg?raw=true "Without Remember Me")

If the details entered by the user is invalid then the error message is displayed:
![Error](/Six.jpg?raw=true "Error Message")

Once the user Login and then Logout the Thank You message is displayed.
![Thank You](/Eight.jpg?raw=true "Logout")

One more functionality with the project is to display the mysql table data in the JSP Table.
![Data in Table](/Seven.jpg?raw=true "Table")
